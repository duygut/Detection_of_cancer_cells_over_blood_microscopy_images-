## Detection of cancer cells over blood microscopy images based on shape anomaly

The codes in this repository have been implemented in MATLAB.

* The aim of this project is detecting white blood cancer cells based on the collected images by pattern recognition and machine learning techniques. 

* The project has 6 main topics:

1. Image acquisition
2. Image preprocessing
3. Image Segmentation
4. Morphologic Operations
5. Feature Extraction
6. Clasification

* In this project the different results have been shown with different methods and their impact on classification accuracy. 
	- CIELAB L*a*b color segmentation and K-Means clustering used for image segmentation,
	- Watershed algorithm applied to detect and separate overlapped white blood cells. 
	- Texture, statistical and geometrical features are used for feature extraction of white blood cells 
	- Support Vector Machine and Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network used for classification. 

In total 108 images were analyzed and up to 95% accuracy has been achieved.
